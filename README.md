PyUADE – A retro music player using UADE (Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator) as a back end

This is mainly a personal project for now. I started working on this because there I found no other convenient way to play a huge library of all kinds of retro tunes under Linux besides the ages old and cumbersome Deli Player 2 in WINE. My player of choice would be Foobar2000, but it’s not open source and doesn’t natively run under Linux. I was looking for a project to get some more Python experience so I started PyUADE.
